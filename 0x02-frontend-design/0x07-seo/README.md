### Introduction
- SEO short for search engine optimization, is about helping search engines understand website content, and helping users find website and make a decision about whether they should visit your site through a search engine.

## SEO Content

### How Google Search Works
- Google Search is a fully-automated search engine that uses software known as web crawlers that explore the web regularly to find pages to add to its index.

- **Stages of Google Search**
- Crawling: Google downloads text, images, and videos from pages it found on the internet with automated programs called crawlers.
- Indexing: Google analyzes the text, images, and video files on the page, and stores the information in the Google index, which is a large database.
- Serving search results: When a user searches on Google, Google returns information that's relevant to the user's query.
