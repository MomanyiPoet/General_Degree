## Overview

### Introduction

Imagine the front end of a website or application as the part you directly interact with â€“ it's what you see, click, and experience. Front-end development is like the architect and artist working together to create a beautiful and user-friendly space.

This repository contains:
- Frontend Design: Using Figma and various adobe softwares (Illustrator, photoshop) to design content, logos, images.
- Git/ GitHub: It is a distributed version control system used to track changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on projects while keeping a complete history of changes.
- HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): Think of HTML as the framework of a building. It structures the content on a webpage, defining things like headings, paragraphs, and images.
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): Now, imagine CSS as the paint and decoration. It's responsible for the layout, colors, and overall visual appeal. CSS styles the HTML elements to make them look aesthetically pleasing.
- JavaScript: JavaScript is like the magic that brings the website to life. It adds interactivity, making elements move, change, and respond to your actions. It's the dynamic force that turns a webpage into an engaging experience.
- Frameworks and Libraries: Tools like React, Vue, or Angular are like pre-built blueprints that make front-end development more efficient. They provide reusable components and structures, allowing developers to create captivating interfaces faster.
