### Introduction
- CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. It is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML.
- Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of low-level utility classes to build designs directly in your markup. Unlike traditional CSS frameworks that come with predefined components, Tailwind focuses on providing small, composable utility classes that can be combined to create custom styles.
