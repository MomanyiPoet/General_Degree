## Overview

### Induction
- We will be creating a Weather API project. The Portfolio Project will be found at the Root Repository.

### Introduction
- Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of low-level utility classes to build designs directly in your markup. Unlike traditional CSS frameworks that come with predefined components, Tailwind focuses on providing small, composable utility classes that can be combined to create custom styles.

- Key features of Tailwind CSS include:
1. Utility-First Approach: Tailwind promotes a utility-first approach, where you apply small utility classes directly to your HTML elements. This approach allows for rapid development and flexibility.
2. Composable: Tailwind classes are designed to be composable, meaning you can combine multiple utility classes to achieve the desired styling. This flexibility allows for highly customized designs.
3. Responsive Design: Tailwind includes responsive utility classes, making it easy to create designs that adapt to different screen sizes. You can apply different styles based on breakpoints, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.
4. Configuration: Tailwind is highly customizable through a configuration file. You can customize colors, spacing, fonts, and more to match your project's design system.
5. Plugins: Tailwind supports plugins that extend its functionality. This allows you to add additional utilities, components, or themes to Tailwind to suit your project's needs.
